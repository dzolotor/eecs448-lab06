Purposely inserted bugs:

    isEmpty() returns true when the list is not empty
    addBack() adds to front instead of back
    removeBack() does not remove the node from the list or decrement the list size
    removeFront() does not remove the node from the list or decrement the list size

NOTE: removeBack() and removeFront() always return false which satisfy the @return because nothing was removed
